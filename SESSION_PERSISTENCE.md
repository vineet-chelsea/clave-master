# âœ… Session Persistence Added

## Problem

When UI refreshes, the component loses state and can't tell if a process is running.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Check Active Sessions on Load
- On page load, check for running sessions
- Restore mode (auto or manual)
- Restore program/config
- Show correct UI

### 2. Chart Data Updates
- Separate effect to update charts
- Updates whenever pressure/temperature changes
- Maintains chart history

## How It Works

**On Page Load:**
```
Check API for running sessions
    â†“
Found active session?
    â†“ YES
Restore to ProcessMonitor view
    â†“
Continue showing progress
```

**Chart Updates:**
```
Every second:
Sensor data changes
    â†“
Add to chart
    â†“
Keep last 60 points
```

## What Now Works

âœ… **Page refresh** - Detects active session and shows it  
âœ… **Chart data** - Updates in real-time  
âœ… **Process visibility** - Always know if process is running  
âœ… **State restoration** - Picks up where it left off  

## Everything Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

Refresh the page and you'll see your running process is still there!
