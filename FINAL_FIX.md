# âœ… Final Fix: Clean Old Sessions

## Problem Found

The database had **old "running" sessions** (IDs 5-14) that were created when the bug existed. When you restart the service, it sees these sessions and starts control for them.

## Solution

1. **Clean database** - Set all old 'running' sessions to 'stopped'
2. **Better filter** - Only pick up sessions created in last 1 minute
3. **Manual control** - Only starts when YOU create a session

## What I Did

1. Updated all old 'running' sessions to 'stopped' 
2. Added time filter: `start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 minute'`
3. Restarted service with clean state

## How It Works Now

Service starts:
- âœ… No auto-start
- âœ… Just reads sensors
- âœ… Waits for NEW session from UI

When you create session from UI:
- âœ… Service detects it
- âœ… Starts control
- âœ… Valve adjusts every 15 seconds

## The System is Clean! ðŸŽ‰

No more unwanted auto-starts!
