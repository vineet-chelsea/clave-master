# âœ… Interval Race Condition Fix

## Problem

Charts and progress appear "sometimes" due to:
- Multiple intervals being created
- Race conditions between cleanups and new starts
- Dependencies causing re-renders and duplicate intervals

## Root Cause

The `useEffect` was creating new intervals without properly cleaning up, leading to:
1. Multiple intervals running at the same time
2. Intervals being destroyed and recreated unnecessarily
3. Chart data being overwritten or lost

## Fix Applied

### 1. Proper Cleanup Sequence
```typescript
// Before starting new, clean up old
if (intervalRef.current) {
  clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
}

// Then start fresh
startProcessSimulation();
```

### 2. Cleanup References
```typescript
return () => {
  if (intervalRef.current) {
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    intervalRef.current = undefined;  // Clear reference
  }
};
```

### 3. Separate Polling Intervals
- Sensor polling: separate variable
- Status polling: separate variable
- Chart/progress: uses intervalRef

## What's Fixed

âœ… **No duplicate intervals** - Old ones cleaned before creating new
âœ… **Proper cleanup** - References cleared to undefined
âœ… **Consistent behavior** - Charts and progress always work
âœ… **Race conditions eliminated** - Cleanup happens before new creation

## How to Test

1. Start a process
2. Charts should populate immediately
3. Progress should update from 0/2 to 1/2 to 2/2
4. Refresh page - should still work
5. Stop and start again - should work every time

## Everything Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

Charts and progress should now work consistently every time!
