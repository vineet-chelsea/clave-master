# âœ… Stop Process Fix

## Problem

When pressing "STOP PROCESS", the program doesn't stop and stays paused.

## Root Cause

Stop handler wasn't:
1. Cleaning up intervals properly
2. Waiting for API response
3. Returning to selection screen

## Fix Applied

Enhanced stop handler:

### 1. Proper Cleanup
```typescript
if (intervalRef.current) {
  clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  intervalRef.current = undefined;  // Clear reference
}
```

### 2. API Response Handling
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/stop-control', { method: 'POST' });
const result = await response.json();
console.log('Stop API response:', result);
```

### 3. Logging
- Logs when stop is called
- Logs API response
- Logs any errors

## What's Fixed

âœ… **Intervals cleared** - No more running intervals after stop  
âœ… **API called** - Backend session marked as stopped  
âœ… **Goes back** - Returns to selection screen  
âœ… **Debug info** - Console logs show what's happening  

## Test It

1. Start a process
2. Click "STOP PROCESS"
3. Should:
   - Show toast "Process Stopped"
   - Return to selection screen
   - Backend marks session as stopped
   - Intervals cleaned up

## Everything Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

Stop should now work properly!
