# âœ… Multiple Session Detection Fix

## Problem

System wasn't detecting when a NEW session was created because:
1. It only checked for sessions created in last 1 minute
2. It required session ID > last_checked
3. This broke after page refresh or restarts

## New Approach

Instead of checking "new sessions", now checks for:
1. ANY running session in database
2. Compares to what we're currently tracking
3. Starts control if it's a different session

## How It Works

```
Every second:
  Check database for running sessions
    â†“
  Found one?
    â†“
  Is it different from what we're tracking?
    â†“ YES
  Start control for this session
    â†“
  Mark as "last checked"
```

## Key Changes

**Before:**
- Only checked "new" sessions (last 1 minute)
- Required ID > last_checked
- Failed after restart

**After:**
- Checks ALL running sessions
- Compares session ID to track
- Always picks up current active session

## Result

âœ… **Can start new sessions** - Always finds active session  
âœ… **Works after refresh** - Picks up existing session  
âœ… **No conflicts** - Only tracks one session at a time  
âœ… **Proper detection** - Finds session regardless of when created  

## Everything Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

System will now properly detect and start control for sessions!
