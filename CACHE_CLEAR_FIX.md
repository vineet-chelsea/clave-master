# âœ… Cache Clear Fix

## Error
```
The requested module does not provide an export named 'default'
```

## Root Cause

Dev server cache issue after syntax errors. The cached version of the file has invalid exports.

## Fix Applied

Cleared dev server cache by stopping node processes.

## How to Restart

### 1. Stop Dev Server
If running, press Ctrl+C in the terminal running `npm run dev`

### 2. Clean Start
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Hard Refresh
In browser, press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Ctrl+F5)

## Everything Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

Cache cleared, exports are correct. Restart dev server and refresh browser!
