# âœ… Valve Control Fix Applied

## Problem
The `write_holding_registers` method was being called incorrectly.

## Solution Applied âœ…

Changed from:
```python
result = self.plc_client.write_holding_registers(
    VALVE_CONTROL_REGISTER,
    values=[value],
    slave=self.slave_id
)
```

To correct method:
```python
result = self.plc_client.write_register(
    VALVE_CONTROL_REGISTER,
    value,
    slave=self.slave_id
)
```

## What Changed

- âœ… Correct method: `write_register()` (single register)
- âœ… Correct syntax: `write_register(address, value, slave=id)`
- âœ… Added confirmation messages when valve is set
- âœ… Added error logging if write fails

## How to Test

Make sure COM10 is available (stop any other Modbus software):

```bash
cd backend
python test_valve_control.py
```

This will test:
- Write valve to 0
- Write valve to 1000
- Write valve to 2000
- Write valve to 3000
- Write valve to 4000
- Verify each write by reading back

## Run the Controller

```bash
cd backend
python pressure_controller.py 20 1
```

This will:
1. Set valve to 0 initially
2. Monitor pressure
3. Adjust valve every 30 seconds if needed
4. Display: `[OK] Set valve to X/4000` when adjusting

## Expected Output

```
============================================================
Pressure Control System
============================================================
Target Pressure: 20 PSI
Duration: 1 minutes
Tolerance: Â±1 PSI
Control Interval: 30 seconds
============================================================

[OK] Connected to PostgreSQL
[OK] Created session: 123
[OK] Connected to PLC on COM10
[OK] Set valve to 0/4000
[OK] Initialized valve position: 0/4000

[12:30:45] Pressure: 18.5 PSI / Target: 20.0 PSI | Valve: 0/4000 | Time left: 1 min
...
[12:31:00] Pressure: 19.2 PSI / Target: 20.0 PSI | Valve: 0/4000 | Time left: 0 min
[CONTROL] Pressure low (19.2 < 20.0), increasing valve to 200
[OK] Set valve to 200/4000
```

## Key Changes

1. âœ… Correct Modbus write method
2. âœ… Proper parameter format
3. âœ… Confirmation messages
4. âœ… Error handling

The valve control should now work correctly! ðŸŽ‰

## Note

The "Access is denied" error means COM10 is currently in use. Make sure:
- No other Modbus software is running
- sensor_service.py is stopped if running
- Serial port is not locked

Then try the test again.
