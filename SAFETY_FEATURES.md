# ✅ Safety Features Added

## What Was Added

### 1. Auto-Stop on Session Loss
- If frontend disconnects or crashes, backend will detect it
- After 5 minutes of no active session, control stops automatically
- Valve closes to safe position (0)

### 2. Stop/Complete Detection
- Detects when session status changes to 'stopped' or 'completed'
- Immediately stops control loop
- Closes valve to safe position

### 3. Resume from Pause
- Service watches for status changes
- Automatically resumes when status changes to 'running'
- No manual restart needed

## How It Works

```
Frontend Running
    ↓ (every second)
Service checks database
    ↓
Session status = 'running'
    ↓
Valve controls actively
    ↓
Frontend stops/crashes
    ↓
No session updates
    ↓
5 minutes timeout
    ↓
Service stops control
    ↓
Valve closes (0)
```

## Safety Features

✅ **Auto-stop on disconnect** - 5 minute timeout  
✅ **Auto-stop on completion** - Detects finished sessions  
✅ **Valve safety** - Automatically closes valve when stopping  
✅ **Status monitoring** - Checks database every second  
✅ **Graceful shutdown** - Clean exit when stopped  

## What Happens When

### Frontend Crashes:
1. Service keeps running
2. No session updates for 5 minutes
3. Safety timeout triggers
4. Control stops, valve closes

### User Stops Process:
1. UI calls `/api/stop-control`
2. Database status = 'stopped'
3. Service detects immediately
4. Control stops, valve closes

### Session Completes:
1. Timer runs out
2. Database status = 'completed'
3. Service detects
4. Control stops, valve closes

## Everything is Safe! 🛡️

The system will never leave the valve open if frontend disconnects.
