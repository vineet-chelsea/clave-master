# âœ… Progress Update Fix

## Problem

Step progress always starts from 0, even when resuming an active session that's been running for a while.

## Root Cause

Progress calculation didn't account for:
1. Resumed sessions (started earlier)
2. Time already elapsed
3. Need to track actual elapsed time vs. duration

## Fix Applied

Enhanced progress calculation to:
1. Track actual progress value
2. Increment properly (not reset)
3. Debug log every 10 iterations
4. Show current vs. new progress

## Debug Logging

Console will show:
```
[PROGRESS] {currentProgress, newProgress, duration, stepMinutes}
```

## What's Fixed

âœ… **Proper progress** - Increments from current value  
âœ… **Accurate display** - Shows actual time elapsed  
âœ… **Debug info** - Logs show calculation details  
âœ… **Resume friendly** - Works when resuming sessions  

## Test It

1. Start a 2-minute session
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Progress should show ~25% (not 0%)
4. Check console for progress logs

## Everything Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

Progress should now accurately reflect elapsed time!
