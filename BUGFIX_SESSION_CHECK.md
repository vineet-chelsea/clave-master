# âœ… Bug Fixed: Auto-Start on Service Start

## Problem

When you start the sensor service, it was checking for ALL sessions with status='running' and starting control for them, even if you didn't start a session through the UI.

## Root Cause

The service was checking:
```python
WHERE status='running' AND target_pressure IS NOT NULL
```

This would find old sessions that were still marked as "running" in the database.

## Fix Applied

Added `last_checked_session_id` to track which sessions we've already processed:

```python
WHERE status='running' AND target_pressure IS NOT NULL AND id > %s
```

Now it only picks up NEW sessions that haven't been processed yet.

## What This Means

âœ… **Service starts** - Just reads sensors, doesn't auto-start control  
âœ… **UI creates session** - Service detects NEW session  
âœ… **Service starts control** - Only for sessions created by UI  
âœ… **No auto-start** - Won't pick up old sessions  

## How It Works Now

1. Service starts â†’ reads sensors only
2. UI creates new session â†’ API adds to database
3. Service detects NEW session â†’ starts control automatically
4. Control runs â†’ valve adjusts every 15 seconds
5. Session completes â†’ control stops, valve closes

## Everything Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

Service will now only start control when YOU start a session from the UI!
