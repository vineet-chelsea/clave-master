# ✅ History Section - Complete Data Implementation

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
History section was only showing limited logs from `process_logs` table:
- ⚠️ Limited to 100 records
- ⚠️ Missing most sensor readings
- ⚠️ Charts incomplete
- ⚠️ Spreadsheet incomplete

### Solution
API now fetches ALL sensor readings from `sensor_readings` table within the session time range:
- ✅ Complete data for entire process
- ✅ All sensor readings included
- ✅ Full time range coverage
- ✅ Complete charts
- ✅ Complete spreadsheets

## How It Works Now

### API Endpoint: `/api/sessions/<id>/logs`

**For completed sessions:**
```sql
SELECT timestamp, pressure, temperature 
FROM sensor_readings 
WHERE timestamp >= start_time AND timestamp <= end_time 
ORDER BY timestamp ASC
```

**For running sessions:**
```sql
SELECT timestamp, pressure, temperature 
FROM sensor_readings 
WHERE timestamp >= start_time
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1000
```

### Key Features

1. **Session time range detection**
   - Gets `start_time` and `end_time` from `process_sessions`
   - Filters sensor readings by these timestamps

2. **Complete data coverage**
   - Returns ALL readings within the session period
   - No 100-record limit
   - Every second of data included

3. **Proper ordering**
   - Completed: ASC order (chronological)
   - Running: DESC then reversed (most recent first)

## What's Included Now

### Charts
- ✅ Complete pressure chart for entire process
- ✅ Complete temperature chart for entire process
- ✅ All data points from start to end
- ✅ Accurate time axis

### Spreadsheet Export
- ✅ All sensor readings included
- ✅ Complete time range
- ✅ Pressure, temperature, timestamp
- ✅ Proper date/time formatting

## Example

### Session: Test Program (6 minutes, 6 steps)

**Before:**
- Only 100 records shown
- Missing most data points
- Incomplete charts

**After:**
- ~360 records (6 min × 60 sec)
- Complete data coverage
- All 6 steps visible in chart
- Full Excel export

### Chart Data Points
```
Step 1: 7.5 PSI for 1 min → 60 points
Step 2: 10 PSI for 1 min → 60 points
Step 3: 22.5 PSI for 1 min → 60 points
Step 4: 22.5 PSI for 1 min → 60 points
Step 5: 42.5 PSI for 1 min → 60 points
Step 6: 42.5 PSI for 1 min → 60 points
───────────────────────────────────
Total: 360 data points
```

### Excel Export
- 360 rows (one per second)
- Columns: Timestamp, Pressure, Temperature
- Complete coverage from start to end

## Testing

1. Complete a session (e.g., Test Program)
2. Go to History section
3. Select the completed session
4. View charts
5. Download Excel
6. ✅ Charts show complete data
7. ✅ Excel has all rows

## Summary

The history section now:
- ✅ Fetches ALL sensor readings for the session
- ✅ Covers complete time range
- ✅ No 100-record limit
- ✅ Complete charts
- ✅ Complete spreadsheets
- ✅ Works for both completed and running sessions

**History section now shows complete data for the entire process time range!** 🎉
