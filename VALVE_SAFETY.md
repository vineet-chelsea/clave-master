# ✅ Valve Safety Feature Added

## What Was Added

Automatic valve closure to position 0 when processes complete or stop.

## Safety Triggers

Valve closes to 0 in these situations:

1. ✅ **Process Completes** - Timer reaches end
2. ✅ **User Stops** - User clicks Stop button
3. ✅ **Frontend Disconnects** - 5 minute timeout
4. ✅ **Session Completed** - Database status = 'completed'
5. ✅ **Session Stopped** - Database status = 'stopped'

## How It Works

```python
# When process completes or stops:
self.set_valve_position(0)
print("[SAFETY] Valve closed to 0/4000")
```

## All Safety Points Covered

✅ **Complete** - Valve closes on completion  
✅ **Stop** - Valve closes when stopped  
✅ **Disconnect** - Valve closes after 5 min timeout  
✅ **Error** - Valve closes on errors  
✅ **Cleanup** - Valve closes on service stop  

## Everything is Safe! 🛡️

The valve will never remain open after a process ends!
