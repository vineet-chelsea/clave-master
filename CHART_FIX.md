# âœ… Chart Fix Applied

## Problem

Graphs weren't populating even though real-time data was coming.

## Root Cause

The `startProcessSimulation` function had duplicate code for updating step progress and chart data wasn't being updated correctly.

## Fix Applied

Cleaned up `startProcessSimulation`:
1. âœ… Removed duplicate progress update code
2. âœ… Chart updates every second with current sensor data
3. âœ… Progress bar updates correctly
4. âœ… Keeps last 60 data points (1 minute of history)

## What the Chart Shows Now

- **X-axis**: Time (HH:MM:SS format)
- **Y-axis**: Value
- **Pressure line**: Current pressure in PSI
- **Temperature line**: Current temperature in Â°C
- **Updates**: Every 1 second
- **History**: Last 60 points (1 minute)

## How It Works

Every 1 second:
1. Fetch latest sensor reading from API
2. Add to chart data array
3. Keep only last 60 points (sliding window)
4. Chart automatically updates

## Everything Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

Charts should now populate with real-time data!
