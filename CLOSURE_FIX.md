# ✅ Closure Problem Fixed

## Problem

`currentPressure` in the setInterval closure was capturing the initial value (0) when the interval was created, and it never got updated with fresh data.

Console showed:
```javascript
currentPressure: 0  // ❌ Stale value from when interval started
```

## Root Cause

The interval closure captures the values at creation time. Even though state is updated, the closure still uses old values.

## Fix Applied

Instead of relying on closure, **fetch fresh sensor data directly inside the interval**:

```typescript
intervalRef.current = setInterval(async () => {
  // Fetch fresh data for THIS iteration
  const response = await fetch('/api/sensor-readings/latest');
  const data = await response.json();
  
  const pressure = data.pressure;
  const temperature = data.temperature;
  
  // Use fresh values, not closure values
  setChartData(prev => [...prev, {
    time: timeStr,
    pressure: pressure,  // Fresh value!
    temperature: temperature  // Fresh value!
  }]);
}, 1000);
```

## What's Fixed

✅ **Fresh data every second** - Fetches directly in interval  
✅ **No stale values** - Doesn't rely on closure  
✅ **Correct pressure** - Shows actual sensor reading  
✅ **Temperature correct** - Shows actual sensor reading  

## Result

Console will now show:
```javascript
currentPressure: 15.8  // ✅ Fresh value
temperature: 28.8  // ✅ Fresh value
```

## Everything Fixed! 🎉

The chart will now use fresh sensor data every second!
