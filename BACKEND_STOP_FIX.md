# ‚úÖ Backend Stop Fix

## Problem

Backend process stays "paused" even after clicking stop. The service doesn't detect the stop signal.

## Root Cause

The stop API was only updating 'running' sessions, not 'paused' ones:

```sql
WHERE status='running'  -- ‚ùå Misses paused sessions
```

## Fix Applied

Updated stop API to handle both states:

```sql
WHERE status IN ('running', 'paused')  -- ‚úÖ Handles both
```

Also added debug logging to track what's happening.

## What Changed

### 1. Stop API
- Now updates BOTH 'running' AND 'paused' sessions
- Logs how many rows were affected
- Returns count for debugging

### 2. Pause/Resume APIs
- Added row count logging
- Better error messages

### 3. Debug Output
Now you'll see in Terminal 2 (API server):
```
[API] Stopped 1 session(s)
```

## How It Works Now

**Clicking STOP:**
1. UI calls `/api/stop-control`
2. API updates ALL sessions (running OR paused) to 'stopped'
3. Service sees status='stopped' in database
4. Control loop exits
5. Valve closes to 0

## Everything Fixed! üéâ

Backend will now properly stop from paused state!
